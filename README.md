# AIYGoogleKit
This is an open-source project for the Google Vision and Voice Kits. Project developed by Justin Su and Ryan Pulla at Ann Arbor Pioneer High School. The user will be able to interact with the Google Voice and Visions kits.

Voice Kit: Ask google to play a song of your choice with voice recognition.

Vision Kit: Face recognition with machine learning.

# How to get started!

The code will need to be run on a compiler, preferably Microsoft's Visual Studio Code or Apple's XCode Softwares (online compliers are acceptable, but not prefered). 

First off, import the project from Github. Then, use pip to install the required libraries provided at the top of the code. Finally, import the file onto the raspberry pi to run the program. Thats it! Enjoy!
